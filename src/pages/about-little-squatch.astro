      <p class="mb-6">
        Who is the Little Squatch? Well my human name is Christopher Garza and
        I'm glad you stopped by to take a look at my blog.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-6">
        This blog is just my personal corner of the web to express my creative
        side. I am originally from Dublin, Texas, a small quiet town in
        north-central Texas. I now live in Austin, Texas where I run my own
        company.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-6">
        My full time job is being my own boss for my company based in Austin
        called <a href="#" target="_blank">Cobalt Web Technologies</a>. Working
        in tech field, specifically building modern web apps I built this blog
        to show off some of my photos and tell some stories to the world.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-6">
        Obvisouly, one of my hobbies is photography and travel. I definitely
        enjoy the technical aspects of photography. While I suppose I am bit
        "left-brained" and not super artistic I do try to express my creative
        side here. I'm certainly no professional photographer or even care to
        make it into a career, I just enjoy taking photos and traveling. I hope
        you enjoy taking a look at my blog and inspire you too.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-6">
        Thanks for stopping by and if you have any questions feel free to <a
          href="/contact">shoot me a message</a
        >.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-6">
        P.S. If you ever see a squatch running around in the wild don't feed or
        pet it! Stay back at least 100 feet from any wild animals please.
