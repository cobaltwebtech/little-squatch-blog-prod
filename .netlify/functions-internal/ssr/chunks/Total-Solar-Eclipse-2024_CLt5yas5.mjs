I have a habit of screwing my filters onto my lenses pretty snugly so they don\u2019t accidentally unscrew off. But, in this case I should have left it screwed on very loosely. This would make it easier to take off during totality. When totality occurred I went to unscrew the filter and it was on tight and when I went to take it off the camera moved and I had to reframe the eclipse.

I met a bunch of really nice people from the UK, North Carolina, and California. They were from everywhere to share the experience.
